README

The play-java project is a basic Address book meant to add, edit, delete, 
and get a list of friends.
	This project uses an in memory database. As a result of this in order
 to run this application the first time the following script needs to be 
 run on the in memory database:

	create table friend (
        email                         varchar(255) not null,
        fname                         varchar(255),
        lname                         varchar(255),
        photo_url                     varchar(255),
        constraint pk_friend primary key (email)"
    );

 As we are running this aplication in debug mode there should be a prompt 
 allowing you to automatically appply the required Evolutions.

The test cases for this application are AddressBookControllerTest.java and IntegrationTest.java

This code can be ran using activator ui.
